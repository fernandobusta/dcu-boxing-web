Congratulations to Terry Mc Entee and Gavin Ryan, DCUâ€™s 2024 Porto Box Cup Champions at 71KG and 57KG. 3 days, 3 fights each, 6 straight dominations altogether. A flawless return from Terry after a break from competing, and a great display from Gavin as per usual. We look forward to seeing both champions in the ring again ðŸ¥ŠðŸ”¥ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª

Major respect to our Finalist, Faolan Rahill, who came up short against a top level Spanish champion. Great experience nonetheless ðŸ”¥

Nicole Buckley made her way to the semi finals. Great back and forth in both of her fights ðŸ¥Š

Shane Carter, a member who has been with DCU BC for 10 years, fought for the club for the last time in this tournament. Win or lose, he has already cemented his name in a way that will be remembered by the club ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª

Highlights of our champions in the finals:

- Gavin Ryan (57KG)
- Terry Mc Entee (71KG)

Well done to all our elites and a great Easter to you all ðŸ¥Š
